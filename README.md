# Automated Charity Donation Smart Contract

This project implements a smart contract on the Stellar blockchain using the Soroban SDK to facilitate automated charitable donations.

## Features

* Schedule donations to pre-defined charities based on user input.
* Simple charity management (adding charities is currently not supported, but the code can be extended for this).
* Designed for educational purposes and demonstration on test networks like Stellar's Futurenet. 

## Technology Stack

* Soroban SDK (Rust library for developing smart contracts on Stellar)
* Rust (programming language)
